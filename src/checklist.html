            <h1>Storage Checklist</h1>
            <p>If you're downsizing your home or if you just want to declutter you may be in need of a self-storage
                unit. Follow our checklist to learn more about your options such as full-service storage vs.
                self-storage, figuring out how much space you need, considering insurance, and how to optimize the
                storage space.</p>

                    <label for="insurance">Consider Purchasing Insurance</label>
                    <p class="checklist__text">Insure items before putting them in storage. Even if belongings are
                        covered under an existing
                        homeowners or renters insurance policy, you should call your provider to double-check that items
                        will still be covered when they are “off-premise.” If items aren't covered under your current
                        policy, consider purchasing additional coverage. Be aware that many storage facilities provide
                        affordable self-storage insurance options. This added protection may be free of charge as well.

                    <label for="budget">Budget Accordingly</label>
                    <p>When figuring out your overall moving budget, be sure to factor in your storage expenses. The
                        cost of renting a storage unit is typically based on how much and how long you store.
                        Self-storage facilities usually offer contracts on a month-to-month basis. Contracts offered by
                        full-service storage facilities vary from company to company. Some insist on a three month
                        minimum, while others offer month-to-month services.</p>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="choose">
                    <label for="choose">Choose Full-Service Storage or Self-Storage</label>
                    <p>If you live in a high-rise building or an urban area where parking is an issue, consider hiring a
                        full-service storage company. Using this type of storage means that storage facility
                        representatives will deliver your storage unit to you and retrieve items when you need them.
                        While convenient, this type of storage service tends to be more expensive than self-storage.
                        Most customers opt for self-storage facilities because of their affordability and flexible
                        rental terms.</p>

                    <p>From Public Storage to U-Haul Storage, there are numerous self-storage facilities available to
                        you. Before booking a unit, make sure that the storage facility of choice is located near your
                        home. This way, you won't have any trouble visiting the storage unit when you need to drop-off
                        or pick-up an item.</p>

                    <p>To compare storage facility prices, use Moving.com's 'Find Storage Now' tool. We'll pull quotes
                        from the closest storage unit facilities near your new home to compare. You can even sort them
                        by star ratings from other people, their price and distance from your home. When using
                        Moving.com's storage tool, you can also filter by features such as climate control, drive-up
                        access and 24-hour access.</p>

                    <p>Storage units come in a number of sizes. In fact, the majority of self-storage facilities offer
                        multiple size units for rent. The most common sizes include 5'x5', 5'x10', 10'x10', 10'x15' and
                        10'x20' storage units. In addition, many facilities offer smaller and larger sizes for
                        customers.</p>

                    <p>Do you need a climate controlled unit? How about 24-hour access? Before booking a storage unit,
                        determine your wants and needs when it comes to storage unit amenities. A few amenities and
                        features to consider include accessibility, video monitoring, number of locks, hours of
                        operation, sizes offered, security, indoor vs. outdoor, climate control and lighting.</p>

                        restrictions. Your storage facility should be able to provide you with a list of what you can
                        and cannot put in storage. Items that are generally not allowed in storage include gasoline,
                        fertilizers, paint, chemicals, fireworks, explosives, narcotics, perishable food, medicine,
                        plants and any flammable objects.

                        storage. Leave a copy of the inventory list inside the storage unit. This way when you go to
                        retrieve belongings, you'll have your inventory list to remind you what is and what is not
                        inside the storage unit.</p>

                        safeguarding items from outside forces (think: dust, moisture, mildew, pests and mold). To
                        protect items: apply protective spray on furniture and leather goods; seal boxes tightly to keep
                        moisture out; store electronics and cords in plastic baggies; pack sweaters and clothing in
                        wardrobe boxes; place mattresses inside special mattress storage bags; and cover furniture in
                        cotton sheets.

                        make it easier to find belongings when you need them.

                    <p>When putting items in storage, be strategic about how and where you decide to place them inside
                        the unit. Box springs and mattresses should be stored flat to prevent damage. Large and heavy
                        items should line the bottom of the storage unit. Lighter items should go on top. To save space,
                        try storing items in a vertical position. For instance, headboards and table legs should be
                        stored standing up. Also, decide which items you plan to take out of storage more often (e.g.
                        seasonal clothing). These items should be placed in a readily accessible spot inside the storage
                        unit.
